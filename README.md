Official Documentation - `https://www.swift.org/documentation/`

## Features
* Majorly used in developing iOS and macOS applications.
* Phones, Desktops, Servers and anything that runs the code.
* Follows Objective-C runtime library; allows C, C++ & swift to run within one program
* Compile is optimized for performance and the language is optimized for development, without compromising on either.

## Introduction
Swift defines away large classes of common programming errors by adopting modern programming patterns:
* Variables are always initialized before use
* Array indices are checked for out-of-bounds errors
* Integers are checked for overflow
* Optional ensures that null values are handled explicitly
* Memory is managed automatically
* Error handling allows controlled recovery from unexpected failures
